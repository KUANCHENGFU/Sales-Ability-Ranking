# Sales Ability Ranking

## Overview
Every day, hot dog vendors are randomly assigned sections of the stadium for which they are responsible. A manager of gameday operations has always felt that some of them are more effective than others at driving demand from fans. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop a framework which is capable of ranking vendorsâ€™ sales abilities. This project is composed of four parts as follows:
1. Model building (multiple linear regression and matrix factorization) and parameter tuning
2. Model evaluation (RMSE)
3. Statistical analysis (ANOVA)
4. Rank aggregation (cross-entropy Monte Carlo algorithm)
